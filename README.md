Mapinguatech Design System
I maintain my own tech stach for personal projects, the idea is to avoid rewriting every key part of a web project every time i start something new. Usually every project will end up using one or many items of this stack:

Design system Maintain cohesion of design/ui through my projects and redy to use components to use in any projects. Any new component that is needed will also be added to the design system for tuture use.

Server Basic integration of a server without business rules and processes, mostly sync processing and db integration. It will handle basic auth and observability 
out of the box, i am assuming every project will need at least that. If i see the need along the way the improvements will be implemented in the core server if it is not 
a business rule, that way i can guarantee it is evolving but not holding complexity based on product, remaining a core implementation for generic use.

Worker/Consumer

Simple implemention of a worker/consumer that will be used to process assincronous tasks, usually tasks that take more resources and can be deferred to a worker. 
It will have basic security and observability implementations out of the box. It will use rabbitmq as message broker. Will be improved over time from the same concept of core service.
